# Contributing

Meerschaum is free and open source software, built to make the lives of data scientists easier. It's my goal to direct the project towards the needs of my users, so the best way you can help steer the development of Meerschaum is to make your voice heard! If you have a need, chances are that someone else down the road will benefit from your present input.

Here are a couple ways you can help out! 💪

1. **Report bugs on the [issues tracker](https://github.com/bmeares/Meerschaum/issues).**

  No matter how large or small, your input is greatly appreciated and gives me a better understanding of the needs of real users.

2. **Join the [discussions board](https://github.com/bmeares/Meerschaum/discussions).**

  Feature requests, suggestions, and even showcases are welcome!

3. **Write and publish [plugins](https://meerschaum.io/reference/plugins/writing-plugins/).**

  If you publish a plugin to the public [`api:mrsm` repository](https://api.mrsm.io/dash/) and post in the [plugins showcase discussion](https://github.com/bmeares/Meerschaum/discussions/50), I will review and possibly include it on the [List of Plugins reference page](https://meerschaum.io/reference/plugins/list-of-plugins/).

## What About Pull Requests?

If you write code directly and open a PR, I will consider your changes, but due to the development pattern of Meerschaum, I likely may choose to reject PRs for a number of reasons. A more effective method of addressing your concerns is to open an issue or start a discussion.

## Sponsorship

Consider [sponsoring Meerschaum](https://github.com/sponsors/bmeares) as a way to prioritize your issues or feature requests. Your support is always greatly appreciated! I am available to implement specific features or to design and deploy your architecture using Meerschaum.
