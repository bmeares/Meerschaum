# üéõÔ∏è Web Console

The Meerschaum Web Console provides a graphical interface for managing your Meerschaum instance, served by the [API instance](/reference/api-instance/). To access it, start the API (`mrsm start api`) and navigate to your host URL (e.g., [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)).

## Webterm

You have complete control of your Meerschaum instance via the webterm, an interactive terminal tied to your username.

Run actions by clicking `Exec`, which uses the values of your currently selected dropdowns (i.e. `-c` for connectors, `-t` for tags, etc.). Alternatively, click the webterm and type your commands directly into the shell session (the choice is yours!).

The controls on the upper right correspond to **refresh** (`‚ü≥`), **fullscreen** / **half-screen** (`‚õ∂` / `üÄ≤`), and (if `tmux` is available) **new tab** (`+`).

## Pipes

On the dashboard, use the left-hand dropdowns to filter your [pipes](/referrence/pipes/) by connector, metric, location, and [tags](/reference/pipes/tags/), and click the blue "Pipes" button the display the pipes' cards.

Alternatively, navigate to the dedicated **Pipes** page on the side navbar (`/dash/pipes`). State is stored in the URL, so this page is the best for sharing links.

Expand the accordion items to view and edit parameters and other metadata about your pipes.
