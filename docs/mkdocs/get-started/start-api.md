# üñ•Ô∏è Meerschaum Web Console

You can use Meerschaum from its web interface. From within a `mrsm` shell, type to commands below to see how:

1. Start the Web API server.

    ```bash
    start api
    ```

    ??? tip "Change the port number"
        To change the port of the API server, add the flag `--port` or `-p`:

        ```bash
        start api --port 8001
        ```

2. Visit port 8000 in a web browser (e.g. [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)) and create an account or login to your instance.

    ??? tip "Register from the command-line"

        You can create users on your instance with the `register user` command.
        ```bash
        register user myuser
        ```

        You can add your own actions with [Meerschaum plugins](/reference/plugins/writing-plugins/#action-plugins).

    Also like the `mrsm` shell, the web console lets you control pipes from several instances (note the instances drop-down on the top right).
